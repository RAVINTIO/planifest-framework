# Loop State: design_critic-p2

> Path: `plan/current/loop-state-{loop-id}.md`. Git-tracked; committed after every
> update so budget/iteration counters survive interrupt/resume (ADR-007). Resume
> convention: see `pause.template.md`. While a loop-state file has `status: active`, the
> ratchet hook is armed for `plan/current/` artifact writes.
